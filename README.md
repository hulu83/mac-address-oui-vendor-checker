# mac-address-oui-vendor-checker
Copy any text (does not matter how long) and this script will filter any mac-address out of your clipboard and show you the vendor.
At the moment you'll receive the output via console. I will add a frontend in the next days.
This script is API-Free. I will receive a fresh update on the vendor-list every 7 Days.
enjoy
